# README

[Published Documentation](https://the-ai-alliance.github.io/trust-safety-evals/)

This repo contains the code and documentation for the AI Alliance _Trust and Safety Evaluations Initiative_, which defines a reference stack for AI model and system evaluation, with evaluations, benchmarks, and leaderboards.

See the [website](https://the-ai-alliance.github.io/trust-safety-evals/) for a more detailed description of this initiative.

At this time, only the "skeleton" documentation is provided. We will be making initial commits of code, etc. soon.
