# Evaluation Reference Stack

This section describes the reference stack that can be used to run the [evaluators]({{site.baseurl}}/evaluators/evaluators) and benchmarks aggregated from them. 

Note the separation between the stack that is agnostic about particular evaluations of interest, and the &ldquo;plug-in&rdquo; evaluators, perhaps as part of a defined benchmark, that meet evaluation objectives.
