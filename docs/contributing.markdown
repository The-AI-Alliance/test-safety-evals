# How to Contribute to this Initiative

We welcome your contributions for defining the full evaluation taxonomy, for building corresponding evaluators and benchmarks, and supporting tools. Visit the initiative's [GitHub repo](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/trust-safety-evals/){:target="repo"} to see what tools and leaderboards are already implemented. See the [issues](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/trust-safety-evals/issues){:target="repo"} and the work tracking projects:

# Joining the Work Group

For people interested in more active participation, we are structuring the work group to support individuals with any level of time and expertise they can contribute. If you want to join our regular meetings or otherwise contribute, use the form on the [Become a collaborator](https://thealliance.ai/become-a-collaborator){:target="aia-website"} page to let us know your interests. Check the box for _AI Trust and Safety WG_ (WG stands for &ldquo;work group&rdquo;) and mention the &ldquo;Trust and Safety Evaluatoins Initiative&rdquo; in the _Message_ box.

# Making Smaller Contributions

You may not have the time or the expertise to be extensively involved, but you can easily make suggestions for small improvements. Contributing changes as [pull requests](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/trust-safety-evals/pulls){:target="repo"} is the best, welcome way to contribute. Alternatively, consider [posting issues](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/trust-safety-evals/issues){:target="repo"}. (Browsing the issues is also a good place to find out where help is needed!) 

For this documentation itself, if you are interested in contributing to it, the sources are in the GitHub repo's [`docs`](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/trust-safety-evals/tree/main/docs){:target="repo-docs"} directory. 

However, notice that every page on this website has _Edit this page on GitHub_ links, making it easy to view a page, then go straight to the source to make edits and submit a PR! This is the best way to help us fix typos and make other small improvements.

The [README](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/trust-safety-evals){:target="repo"} for the source repo explains more details for testing this website locally and for creating more extensive changes as PRs, such as adding new content. The README also describes our "DCO" requirements, which you should understand first.

However, these ways of contributing require you to have a GitHub account. If you don't have one and you want to provide feedback for improvements, then [send us email](mailto:contact@thealliance.ai) with your suggestions. Be sure to mention this particular initiative, as we have many AI Alliance projects and initiatives!
