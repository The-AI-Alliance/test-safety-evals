# Join This Initiative!

Want to join one of our initiative projects? Visit [this AI Alliance webpage](https://thealliance.ai/working-groups/trust-safety#trust-and-safety-form){:target="join-us-form"} and fill in the form. Thank you for your interest.

We welcome your contributions for defining the full evaluation taxonomy, for building the reference stack and the evaluators, benchmarks, and leaderboards for the taxonomy, etc. Visit the initiative's [GitHub repo](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/trust-safety-evals/){:target="repo"} to see what tools and leaderboards are already implemented. See the [issues](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/trust-safety-evals/issues){:target="repo"} and the [work tracking project](https://github.com/orgs/The-AI-Alliance/projects/23/views/1). Here is the project view filtered by _labels_ for the main work streams:

* [Evaluation Platform Reference Stack](https://github.com/orgs/The-AI-Alliance/projects/23/views/1?filterQuery=label%3A"reference+stack"){:target="project23-reference-stack"}
* [Evaluation Taxonomy](https://github.com/orgs/The-AI-Alliance/projects/23/views/1?filterQuery=label%3Ataxonomy){:target="project23-taxonomy"}
* [Evaluators](https://github.com/orgs/The-AI-Alliance/projects/23/views/1?filterQuery=label%3Aevaluators){:target="project23-evaluators"} (which implement the taxonomy...)
* [Evaluation Leaderboard](https://github.com/orgs/The-AI-Alliance/projects/23/views/1?filterQuery=label%3Aleaderboards){:target="project23-leaderboards"}

# Making Smaller Contributions

You may not have the time or the expertise to be extensively involved, but you can easily make suggestions for small improvements. Contributing changes as [pull requests](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/trust-safety-evals/pulls){:target="repo"} is the best, welcome way to contribute. Alternatively, consider [posting issues](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/trust-safety-evals/issues){:target="repo"}. (Browsing the issues is also a good place to find out where help is needed!) 

For this documentation itself, if you are interested in contributing to it, the sources are in the GitHub repo's [`docs`](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/trust-safety-evals/tree/main/docs){:target="repo-docs"} directory. 

However, notice that every page on this website has _Edit this page on GitHub_ links, making it easy to view a page, then go straight to the source to make edits and submit a PR! This is the best way to help us fix typos and make other small improvements.

The [README](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/trust-safety-evals){:target="repo"} for the source repo explains more details for testing this website locally and for creating more extensive changes as PRs, such as adding new content. The README also describes our "DCO" requirements, which you should understand first.

However, these ways of contributing require you to have a GitHub account. If you don't have one and you want to provide feedback for improvements, then [send us email](mailto:contact@thealliance.ai) with your suggestions. Be sure to mention this particular initiative, as we have many AI Alliance projects and initiatives!
