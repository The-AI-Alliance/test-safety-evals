Welcome to the **The AI Alliance** project for **Trust and Safety Evaluations**.

Much like other software, generative AI (&ldquo;GenAI&rdquo;) [_Models_]({{site.baseurl}}/glossary/#model) and the [_AI Systems_]({{site.baseurl}}/glossary/#ai-system) that use them need to be trusted and useful to their users.

[_Evaluation_]({{site.baseurl}}/glossary/#evaluation) aims to provide the evidence for gaining usersâ€™ trust in models and systems. More specifically, evaluation refers to the capability of measuring and quantifying how a model or system responds to inputs. Are the responses within acceptable bounds, for example free of hate speech and [_Hallucinations_]({{site.baseurl}}/glossary/#hallucination), useful to user, cost-effective, etc.?

There are many organizations working on evaluations for safety, broadly defined, and other kinds of measurements, as well as [_Benchmarks_]({{site.baseurl}}/glossary/#benchmark) that aggregate some evaluations and [_Leaderboards_]({{site.baseurl}}/glossary/#leaderboard) that let you see how some models and systems do against benchmarks, without having to execute these benchmarks yourself. 

The **Trust and Safety Evaluations** project addresses several under-served needs:

1. While very good [Taxonomies]({{site.baseurl}}/glossary/#taxonomy) of evaluation in the areas of risk and harms have [emerged]({{site.baseurl}}/taxonomy/taxonomy/#why-build-a-taxonomy), there are other areas of interest where a standard taxonomy, with corresponding evaluations, would be useful. See [taxonomy]({{site.baseurl}}/taxonomy/taxonomy).
2. [_Evaluators_]({{site.baseurl}}/glossary/#evaluator) that implement evaluations in the taxonomy are needed. Some areas are well-covered, while others have no available evaluators. These evaluators can be aggregated into benchmarks. See [evaluators]({{site.baseurl}}/evaluators/evaluators).
3. Leaderboards are needed that provide unique, user-configurable views on different benchmark combinations, which help users focus on the benchmarks most relevant to their needs. See [leaderboards]({{site.baseurl}}/leaderboards/leaderboards).
4. Users need a _reference stack_ of industry-standard OSS tools for evaluation, especially at [_Inference_]({{site.baseurl}}/glossary/#inference) time. See [evaluation reference stack]({{site.baseurl}}/ref-stack/ref-stack).

This website provides the documentation for this project, with links to other resources, including code and leaderboards, as they become available.
